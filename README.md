[![go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/Marfeel/dockerhub/)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Marfeel/dockerhub/v2)

Golang API client.

## Modifications

We added [a sleep interval](https://github.com/Marfeel/dockerhub/blob/994dd6e9fbdfc0a97fbd61d1a9be27163af90aa7/v2/main.go#L269)
in _msecs_ for each request, as a cheap way to not hit the rate-limit of the API.

As of `v2.5.0`, it is also available as a provider parameter. Defaults to _750_.

```tf
provider "dockerhub" {
  sleep_interval = "1000"
}
```
